## Introduction.

### Real Estate Market Analytics Dashboard.

Have you ever wondered what drives property values in your area? This project answers that question by transforming raw **real estate** transaction data into actionable market intelligence. I developed this comprehensive dashboard to help stakeholders visualize $1.38 billion of property sales across multiple towns, revealing hidden patterns and market opportunities.

Using SQL for data extraction and transformation, I built queries that cleaned and structured complex property records into a meaningful datasets. The real magic happened in Power BI, where I designed interactive visualizations that allows users to instantly analyze market trends by property type, location, and time period.

The dashboard offers actionable insights including price trend analysis, seasonal sale patterns, and property value comparisons across different towns. Stakeholders can make data-driven decisions by understanding which areas consistently outperform their assessed values or how different property types perform across market cycles.

What started as raw transaction records has become a strategic tool that reveals the true story behind the numbers; whether you're a real estate investor looking for opportunities or a market analyst tracking long-term trends.

**_Disclaimer_** : _This **real estate sales** dashboard only presents historical property sales data for analytical and informational purposes. While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, this information should not be used as financial advice or an indicator of future market performance. Property values, market trends, and sales figures may vary from current market conditions. Users should verify all information independently and consult qualified real estate professionals before making investment decisions. This dataset may contain aggregated information that excludes certain property types or transactions, and geographic coverage is limited to the specific towns displayed_.

## Issue Definition.

The local **real estate** authority lacks comprehensive visibility into property market trends across multiple towns, hindering informed decision-making for stakeholders. Currently, valuable sales data exists but remains fragmented across various systems, making it difficult to:

1. Compare property values against assessed valuations to identify under/overvalued markets.
2. Track seasonal discripancies in sales volume and pricing.
3. Analyze differences in sales performance between property types.
4. Identify towns and properties with high sales so as to suggest investment decisions.
5. Understand long-term market trends spanning over two decades (2000-2023)
This information gap prevents real estate professionals, investors, and policymakers from making data-driven decisions in a unique market where property values exceed $1.38 billion in total sales. A consolidated analytical solution is needed to transform this transactional data into actionable insights that reveal trends across location, time and property type.
